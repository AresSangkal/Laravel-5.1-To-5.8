				    <h2>3. Refund Policy</h2>
				    <div class="separator"></div>
				    <p class="m-b-15">
					    Pyramd facilitates leads and cash rewards between a business and user providing leads to that business.
					    Users send leads to businesses and receive rewards for genuine leads and/or for successful sales.
					    Any reward is subject to approval by the individual business.
					    It is up to the individual business to honour these rewards and pay in what is due.
					    <br>
					    For business users, once a cash reward has been approved by your business, you will not be entitled to a refund.
					    Please therefore ensure that the lead is genuine before approving the cash reward for the salesperson.
					    Rewards for successful sales will typically be awarded once the purchase of the produce or service has been confirmed.

				    <h2>4. Delivery</h2>

				    <h2>11. Payment of cash rewards</h2>
				    <div class="separator"></div>
				    <p class="m-b-15">
					    Pyramd is a service enabling the passing of leads and referrals to a registered business, and the subsequent passing
					    of monetary rewards from the business to the successful salesperson. Pyramd cannot be held responsible for the failure
					    of a registered business to meet their financial obligations. The transfer of leads and cash rewards is between the
					    applicable parties (registered business and registered salesperson) and should be sorted out between them.
					    <br>
					    Pyramd cannot pursue unpaid rewards on behalf of any user or business. Pyramd can only block registered businesses
					    and users from using the website in the event of continued and deliberate misuse of the website or for failing to
					    uphold their stated obligations.
